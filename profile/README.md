# Delta zero semantic language (aka `d0sl`) version 2
## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

Delta zero semantic language (aka `d0sl`) is a next generation of so called Business Rules Engines (BRE). 
Just like regular BRE’s `d0sl` allows you to implement business logic of your system by using declarative logical specifications language.

## ❓ FAQ
### How d0sl is different from other programming languages?
`d0sl` is not a programming language. It is a specification language allowing to create specifications which can be automatically 
converted into an executable program. Is similar to other low-code/no-code platforms in the sense that it automatically generates programming code.

### Why semantic?
By semantic we mean “meaning”. `d0sl` is a semantic based processing platform allowing to create automated decision [support] systems. 
We use the word “semantic” here because d0sl allows to specify rules using the terms of a subject domain by domain experts who ain’t programmers. 
And to explain solutions made by such systems in the words understandable by them. `d0sl` is essentially a tool to create what we call “semantic” DSL (or sDSL), 
and execute specs written with such DSL.

### What are areas of applications for d0sl?
We use `d0sl` in transaction and event processing systems in telecom, fintech, banking to allow our clients to amend and customize business logic 
of the applications which we develop and provide to them. 
Digital transformation of enterprises creates demand for semantic processing systems in the areas of autonomous decision making/support systems, predictive analytics, 
technology and business process modelling systems and digital twins.
